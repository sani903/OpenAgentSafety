## Overview

**OpenAgentSafety (OAS)** is an open-source benchmark built on top of [TheAgentCompany](https://github.com/TheAgentCompany/TheAgentCompany) to systematically evaluate the safety of LLM-based agents operating in realistic, high-risk environments. Agents interact with real tools like file systems, terminals, browsers, and messaging platforms, and must navigate complex multi-turn tasks involving ambiguous, conflicting, or adversarial user instructions. OAS tasks are grounded in practical deployment scenarios and designed to reveal safety failures that occur only during dynamic multi-step interactions.

We extend and acknowledge the infrastructure of TheAgentCompany and [Sotopia](https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/sotopia), leveraging their robust simulation backend and social interaction modeling.

## Installation & Setup

The setup steps follow TheAgentCompany's benchmark closely. All services (GitLab, ownCloud, RocketChat, etc.) can be launched via Docker in minutes.

<details>
  <summary>Mac/Linux Setup</summary>

```bash
# Requires docker + docker compose + ~30GB disk space
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
curl -fsSL https://github.com/TheAgentCompany/the-agent-company-backup-data/releases/download/setup-script-20241208/setup.sh | sh
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Windows Setup</summary>

```bash
curl -fsSL -o setup.bat https://github.com/TheAgentCompany/the-agent-company-backup-data/releases/download/setup-script-20241208/setup.bat && setup.bat
```
</details>

For full details and troubleshooting tips, refer to [SETUP.md](./docs/SETUP.md).

## Running OpenAgentSafety

Each task is packaged as a Docker image with:
- `utils/init.sh`: initializes the task environment
- `instruction/task.md`: agent-facing task instruction
- `utils/eval.py`: scoring logic

### Running with OpenHands

```bash
sudo su
cd evaluation
bash run_eval.sh \
  --agent-llm-config <group1> \
  --env-llm-config <group2> \
  --outputs-path <outputs> \
  --server-hostname <hostname> \
  --version 1.0.0
```

More details available [here](./evaluation/README.md).
